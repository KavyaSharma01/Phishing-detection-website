# Phishing Detection Website

Welcome to the Phishing Detection Website! This project aims to help users identify whether a given URL is legitimate or compromised. Simply upload a URL, and the website will let you know if it's safe or a phishing attempt.

Description

In the financial industry, the high volume of real-time online transactions makes it vulnerable to fraud. Fraud detection involves security measures to prevent third parties from obtaining funds. One common type of fraud is email phishing, where users are tricked into providing personal information to mock websites that appear legitimate.

Overview

Phishing is a technique used to exploit personal details from unsuspecting users. A phishing website mimics a legitimate site in appearance but directs users to a different destination. These websites steal personal information, leading to illegal transactions and significant harm to users. Despite continuous development of anti-phishing techniques, phishers constantly devise new methods to bypass these mechanisms. This project aims to provide an efficient mechanism for predicting phishing websites.
